# UV Migration Summary

## ✅ Migration Completed Successfully

The IDTool project has been successfully migrated from pip/venv to uv with Python 3.11.

## 🔄 What Changed

### Files Created/Modified:
- ✅ `pyproject.toml` - New project configuration with Python 3.11 requirement
- ✅ `main.py` - Updated shebang to use python3
- ✅ `rebuild_complete_database.py` - Updated shebang to use python3
- ✅ `setup_uv.py` - Migration helper script
- ✅ `run_idtool.sh` - Convenience script for running the main application
- ✅ `rebuild_db.sh` - Convenience script for database rebuild
- ✅ `UV_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide for using uv
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated with uv installation instructions
- ✅ `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Files Removed:
- ❌ `venv/` - Old virtual environment (removed during migration)

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Faster Dependency Resolution**: uv is 10-100x faster than pip
2. **Better Dependency Management**: Automatic lock files for reproducible builds
3. **No Manual venv Management**: uv handles virtual environments automatically
4. **Python 3.11 Compatibility**: Ensures compatibility with geospatial packages
5. **Modern Tooling**: Built for modern Python development workflows

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start:
```bash
# If uv command is not found, clear shell cache first:
hash -r

# Run the main application
./run_idtool.sh

# Or rebuild the database
./rebuild_db.sh

# Or use uv directly
uv run main.py
```

### Package Management:
```bash
# Add new dependencies
uv add package_name

# Update dependencies
uv sync --upgrade --python 3.11

# Run tests
uv run pytest
```

## 📦 Dependencies Installed

All 45 packages were successfully installed with Python 3.11:
- Core geospatial: geopandas, shapely, fiona, pyproj
- Database: psycopg2-binary, sqlalchemy, geoalchemy2
- Data processing: pandas, numpy, pyarrow
- Visualization: matplotlib, folium, branca
- Testing: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Python Version**: 3.11.13 (optimized for geospatial packages)
- **Virtual Environment**: `.venv/` (managed by uv)
- **Lock File**: `uv.lock` (auto-generated for reproducible builds)
- **Project Config**: `pyproject.toml` (modern Python packaging)

## 🎉 Migration Status: COMPLETE

The project is now fully migrated to uv and ready for development. All existing functionality has been preserved while gaining the benefits of modern Python package management.

## 📚 Documentation

- `UV_GUIDE.md` - Complete reference for uv commands
- `README.md` - Updated installation instructions
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration and dependencies

## 🔄 Rollback (if needed)

If you need to go back to the old setup:
```bash
# The old requirements.txt is still available
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
